# Tree of thoughts
A LMQL implementation of something similar to tree of thoughts. Works but is still finicky and a work in progress.

Guides the reasoning by selecting thoughts through a natural selectionish process by evaluating them against user-defined criteria and requirements.

Needs the commit `4f9a9c0965f924dbab18ca8a4bf6d655c87b97de` from [this LMQL fork](https://github.com/LachlanGray/lmql.git) for now.
