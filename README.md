# Tree of thoughts
A LMQL implementation of something similar to tree of thoughts. Kind of works sometimes. Still very much a work in progress.

Uses a natural selectionish process to favour fruitful reasoning.

Needs the commit `4f9a9c0965f924dbab18ca8a4bf6d655c87b97de` from [this LMQL fork](https://github.com/LachlanGray/lmql.git) for now.
